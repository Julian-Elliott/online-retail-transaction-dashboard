# Online Retail Transaction Dashboard

**Online Retail Transaction Dashboard** is a comprehensive data analytics tool designed to streamline customer behavior analysis and sales trend exploration. Using the Online Retail dataset, we developed an interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making across product performance, customer segmentation, and geographic markets.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Content

The dataset contains records of transactions made through an online retail platform between December 2010 and December 2011. It includes:
- `InvoiceNo`: Transaction ID
- `StockCode`: Product ID
- `Description`: Product name
- `Quantity`: Quantity sold (can be negative for returns)
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of transaction
- `UnitPrice`: Price per item
- `CustomerID`: Customer ID (nullable)
- `Country`: Customer’s location

## 📌 Business Requirements

1. **Understand Sales Trends Over Time**  
   Gain insights into how sales evolve daily, weekly, and monthly to better forecast inventory and marketing needs.

2. **Segment Customers by Purchasing Behavior**  
   Identify customer segments based on frequency, recency, and monetary value to inform loyalty strategies.

3. **Identify Top-Performing Products**  
   Recognize which products contribute most to revenue for better stock prioritisation and promotion.

4. **Geographic Sales Analysis**  
   Detect high-performing regions to optimise international targeting and shipping resources.

5. **Measure Impact of Returns on Revenue**  
   Evaluate how returns (invoices with negative quantities) affect overall profitability and customer satisfaction.

6. **Develop an Interactive Dashboard for Stakeholders**  
   Provide an accessible and dynamic visual interface for exploring business performance data.

## 🧪 Hypothesis and How to Validate?

This section outlines the key hypotheses derived from our business objectives and user stories. Each hypothesis is accompanied by a plan for validation through data analysis and visualisation.

---

### 🔍 Summary of Core Hypotheses

| **ID** | **Hypothesis** |
|--------|----------------|
| H1 | The United Kingdom accounts for the majority of total revenue. |
| H2 | A small group of products generates the majority of the revenue. |
| H3 | Return transactions (negative quantities) significantly impact monthly revenue. |
| H4 | High-frequency customers spend significantly more per transaction. |

---

### 🧪 Hypotheses Linked to User Stories

| **User Story** | **Hypothesis** | **How to Validate It** |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **1. Understand Sales Trends Over Time** | Sales volume and revenue follow clear temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly). | Plot sales (`TotalPrice`) over time using line charts grouped by day, week, and month. Identify recurring peaks and dips. |
| **2. Segment Customers by Purchasing Behavior** | A small subset of customers contributes the most revenue and purchases most frequently. | Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and segment customers. Visualise segments using bar charts or scatterplots. |
| **3. Identify Top-Performing Products** | A small number of products account for the majority of total revenue. | Rank products by total revenue (`Quantity * UnitPrice`). Use Pareto or bar charts to display their cumulative impact. |
| **4. Geographic Sales Analysis** | Certain countries (e.g. UK, Netherlands) consistently outperform others in revenue and order count. | Aggregate sales by `Country`. Visualise with maps or horizontal bar charts, optionally filtered by product or date. |
| **5. Measure Impact of Returns on Revenue** | Returned items (negative quantities) significantly affect monthly revenue trends. | Compare gross vs. net revenue by month. Visualise with dual or stacked line charts to show impact of returns. |
| **6. Develop an Interactive Dashboard for Stakeholders** | Interactivity (e.g. filters, slicers) improves the accessibility and insights for non-technical users. | Include interactive elements (date, country, product filters). Validate through team testing or stakeholder feedback. |

## Data Cleaning Summary
This project focuses on preparing transaction data for accurate, consistent, and meaningful sales analysis. Below is a clear summary of the data cleaning steps followed.

### Data Cleaning Steps

1. Dropped Missing Product Descriptions:
Any rows without a product description were deleted, as these records were incomplete and not useful for analysis.

2. Filtered Out Adjustments and Negative Quantities:
Transactions marked as adjustments or with negative quantities (such as product returns) were excluded to focus only on valid sales transactions.

3. Removed Cancelled Orders:
Orders marked as cancelled (identified by invoice numbers containing 'C') were removed to retain only completed sales.

4. Removed Duplicates:
We performed an duplicate check using key columns such as:

- Invoice Number (InvoiceNo)
- Product Code (StockCode)
- Quantity
-Customer ID (CustomerID)
We did this to ensure no repeated transactions remained.

5. Excluded Missing or Unspecified Countries:
Transactions missing a country or marked as 'Unspecified' were dropped to maintain accurate geographic analysis.

### Caveats & Examples:
If a product description was missing, that row was removed (e.g., a transaction without a product name).

Cancelled orders (e.g., InvoiceNo like 'C12345') and returns (transactions with negative quantities) were excluded from the analysis.

Only transactions with a valid country were kept for geographic reporting.


### Feature Engineering Steps:

#### 1. **TotalPrice**
- Multiply `Quantity` by `UnitPrice` for each transaction line to compute total value.  
- Formula: `TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice`

#### 2. **InvoiceMonth**
- Extract the month from `InvoiceDate` for monthly analysis.  
- Formula: `InvoiceMonth = month(InvoiceDate)`

#### 3. **InvoiceDayOfWeek**
- Extract the day of the week from `InvoiceDate` (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday).  
- Formula: `InvoiceDayOfWeek = weekday(InvoiceDate)`

#### 4. **InvoiceWeekOfYear**
- Extract the week number of the year from `InvoiceDate`.  
- Formula: `InvoiceWeekOfYear = week_number(InvoiceDate)`

#### 5. **ReturnsFlag**
- Identify returns by checking if `UnitPrice` or `Quantity` is negative.  
- Flag: `ReturnsFlag = 1` if `UnitPrice < 0` or `Quantity < 0`, else `0`.

#### 6. **Recency**
- Calculate the number of days since the customer's most recent purchase relative to a reference date.  
- Formula:  
  `Recency = ReferenceDate - LastInvoiceDate per CustomerID`

#### 7. **MonetaryValue**
- Total spending by customer across all transactions.  
- Formula:  
  `MonetaryValue = Sum of TotalPrice per CustomerID`

#### 8. **CustomerFrequency**
- Number of unique invoices per `CustomerID` to capture engagement level.  
- Formula:  
  `CustomerFrequency = count_unique(InvoiceNo) per CustomerID`

### 🧰 Python Tools / Libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- `datetime` (via pandas) for date operations

---

### 🔑 Pseudocode:
```plaintext
1. Load dataset into pandas DataFrame.
2. Compute TotalPrice: Quantity * UnitPrice.
3. Convert InvoiceDate to datetime.
4. Extract InvoiceMonth, InvoiceDayOfWeek, InvoiceWeekOfYear from InvoiceDate.
5. Create ReturnsFlag: UnitPrice < 0 or Quantity < 0 → ReturnsFlag = 1 else 0.
6. Calculate Recency per CustomerID:
   - Determine last purchase date per CustomerID.
   - Subtract from reference date.
7. Compute MonetaryValue: Total spending per CustomerID.
8. Compute CustomerFrequency: Number of unique invoices per CustomerID.
9. Merge Recency, MonetaryValue, and CustomerFrequency back to main DataFrame.
